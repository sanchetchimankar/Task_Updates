               <p> A computer is a device that accepts information  </p>
               <p>  (in the form of digitalized data) and manipulates it for some result based on a program,</p>
               <p>  software, or sequence of instructions on how the data is to be processed. </p>

            <p> Complex computers include the means for storing data (including the program,</p>
            <p> which is also a form of data) for some necessary duration. A program may be invariable </p>
            <p> and built into the computer hardware (and called logic circuitry as it is on microprocessors) </p>
            <p> or different programs may be provided to the computer (loaded into its storage and</p>
            <p> then started by an administrator or user). Today's computers have both kinds of programming.</p>
